# Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. Website Updates

## Description

In this project, accessibility was enhanced by adding semantic HTML elements to the source code. The structure of the elements are both logical and easily understood, independent of positioning. For example, the semantic HTML elements help visitors to the site understand the purpose of each section, not just the position on the page. Image descriptions are concise and understandable. The headings are in sequential order. The page title was updated to describe the website to potential visitors. By doing this project, I learned to explore semantic HTML elements and how they work alongside the purpose of each part of a website.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Semantic HTML element can also be viewed in Chrome Development tools. Under Elements you will see and understand the purpose of each part of the page.
